# Kubernetes on OCI Always Free

Terraform-managed Kubernetes platform built around Oracle Cloud's Always Free tier. The goal is to keep a real GitOps cluster online at near-zero cost while still using production-shaped building blocks: managed Kubernetes, ingress, DNS automation, TLS, and Argo CD.

The Terraform code is reusable: with an OCI account, Cloudflare zone, and the documented variables, another operator can use this directory to bring up their own Always Free Kubernetes cluster.

## What This Shows

- **Cost-aware cloud architecture** — OKE control plane, ARM worker nodes, and a small OCI load balancer sized for the free-tier envelope.
- **Terraform separation of concerns** — base cloud infrastructure lives in `infrastructure/`; cluster add-ons live in `platform/`.
- **GitOps operating model** — Argo CD is bootstrapped by Terraform and watches the repo for application manifests.
- **Public-safe secret handling** — platform/core secrets stay in Terraform; app-specific secrets use each app's ignored `config/` files plus committed `.example` templates.
- **Cloudflare-backed edge** — ingress traffic is restricted to Cloudflare CIDRs, DNS is automated by external-dns, and TLS is issued with cert-manager DNS-01 challenges.

## Architecture

Oracle Cloud's [Always Free tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) is one of the most generous cloud offers available for experimenting — especially for compute. The OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) control plane is always free, and the Ampere A1 ARM shapes provide solid resources at no cost.

Inspired by [nce/oci-free-cloud-k8s](https://github.com/nce/oci-free-cloud-k8s), rewritten with additional documentation and configuration changes.

- **Engine:** Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) — free managed control plane
- **Worker nodes:** 2 nodes, each with 2 OCPUs / 12 GB RAM / 100 GB block storage (NVMe SSD)
- **Shape:** VM.Standard.A1.Flex (ARM Ampere A1, from the Always Free allocation of 4 OCPUs / 24 GB RAM)
- **Ingress:** nginx ingress controller with an OCI free-tier load balancer (Cloudflare-only source IPs)
- **DNS:** external-dns with Cloudflare provider for automatic DNS record management (proxied mode)
- **TLS:** cert-manager with Let's Encrypt certificates via Cloudflare DNS-01 challenge — enables Cloudflare Full (Strict) TLS mode for end-to-end encryption
- **GitOps:** Argo CD for continuous deployment from Git

The application layer is intentionally light right now. The platform keeps the GitOps path ready for workloads that make sense for the cluster without carrying unused monitoring-stack leftovers.

See [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md) before running Terraform.

## Usage

### 1. Deploy the infrastructure

```bash
cd infrastructure
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your compartment_id and k8s_api_source_ip
terraform init
terraform apply
```

`terraform apply` creates a kubeconfig file at `~/.kube/k8s-oci-cluster-config`. Use it to interact with the cluster:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/k8s-oci-cluster-config
kubectl get nodes
```

> [!TIP]
> **A1 capacity availability** — Free-tier A1 instances share a limited capacity pool and `terraform apply` may fail with an "Out of capacity" error. Consider upgrading to **Pay As You Go (PAYG)** — it uses the regular capacity pool while Always Free limits still apply.

> [!TIP]
> **Extending worker node drives** — OCI worker nodes don't use the full boot volume by default. Run `/usr/libexec/oci-growfs -y` on each node (e.g. via a shell session in [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/)).

### 2. Deploy platform services

Deploys the nginx ingress controller (with an OCI free-tier load balancer), external-dns for automatic Cloudflare DNS management, cert-manager for automatic TLS certificates, and Argo CD. See [Platform Components](docs/platform.md) for details.

```bash
cd platform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your domain, email, and required platform secrets
terraform init
terraform apply -target=helm_release.cert_manager  # first time only, installs CRDs
terraform apply
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first apply requires `-target=helm_release.cert_manager` because Terraform validates custom resources (like `ClusterIssuer`) against the cluster's CRDs at plan time. Once cert-manager is installed, subsequent applies work normally.

### 3. Deploy applications via GitOps

ArgoCD watches the `apps/` directory and automatically syncs applications to the cluster. Add Application manifests there and push to Git — ArgoCD picks them up, applies them, and prunes removed resources. See [Applications](docs/apps.md) for details.

Application manifests are managed by Argo CD. If an app needs private runtime config, follow that app's `config/` workflow first: copy the committed `.example` files to same-name local files without the `.example` suffix, fill real values, and apply those ignored local files before syncing the app.

```bash
# App manifests are managed by Argo CD.
# App private config is created from each app's ignored config/*.yaml files.
# Add/review manifests under apps/ and push when ready.
```
